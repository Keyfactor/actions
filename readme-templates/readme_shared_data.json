Within the Keyfactor Platform, Orchestrators are used to manage “certificate stores” &mdash; collections of certificates and roots of trust that are found within and used by various applications.\n\nThe Universal Orchestrator is part of the Keyfactor software distribution and is available via the Keyfactor customer portal. For general instructions on installing Capabilities, see the “Keyfactor Command Orchestrator Installation and Configuration Guide” section of the Keyfactor documentation. For configuration details of this specific Capability, see below in this readme.\n\nThe Universal Orchestrator is the successor to the Windows Orchestrator. This Capability plugin only works with the Universal Orchestrator and does not work with the Windows Orchestrator.",
      "pam": "Keyfactor supports the retrieval of credentials from 3rd party Priviledged Access Management (PAM) solutions. Secret values can normally be stored, encrypted at rest, in the Keyfactor Platform database. A PAM Provider can allow these secrets to be stored, managed, and rotated in an external platform. This integration is usually configured on the Keyfactor Platform itself, where the platform can request the credential values when needed. In certain scenarios, a PAM Provider can instead be run on a remote location in conjunction with a Keyfactor Orchestrator to allow credential requests to originate from a location other than the Keyfactor Platform.",

While this AnyAgent continues to work with the Windows Orchestrator, and the Windows Orchestrator is supported alongside the Universal Orchestrator talking to Keyfactor version 9, AnyAgent plugins cannot be used with the Universal Orchestrator.",
