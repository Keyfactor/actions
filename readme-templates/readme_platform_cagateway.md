## Keyfactor AnyCA Gateway Framework Supported

This gateway extension was compiled against version {{ gateway_framework }} of the AnyCA Gateway Framework.  You will need at least this version of the framework Installed.  If you have a later AnyGateway Framework Installed you will probably need to add binding redirects in the CAProxyServer.exe.config file to make things work properly.
